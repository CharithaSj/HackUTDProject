# AgentGrove

Product managers often juggle multiple platforms — Notion, GitHub, Google Slides, and more — making it difficult to track progress and extract insights efficiently.  
Our project solves this problem with a **multi-agent AI system** that brings all these tools together under one intelligent interface.  

Using **NVIDIA’s Nemotron models**, our system automates key tasks like summarizing updates, parsing documents, analyzing GitHub repositories, and interpreting visual data — helping product managers save time, stay organized, and make faster, more informed decisions.

## Story behind AgentGrove
As juniors who’ve interned before, we experienced firsthand how overwhelming it can be to adapt to corporate tools, workflows, and acronyms.  
That sparked the idea — what if AI could simplify this learning curve and help product managers understand and manage their tools effortlessly?  
Conversations with mentors and sponsors like **NVIDIA** and **PNC** confirmed that these challenges are real, motivating us to build a solution that’s both impactful and practical.
